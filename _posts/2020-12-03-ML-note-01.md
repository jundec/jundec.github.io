hypothesis vs. ground-truth  
classification and regression  
supervised vs. unsupervised  
induction vs. deduction  

*NFL theorem*:
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem>

*Machine Learning*: Arthur Samuel, 1901-1990, in IBM.

Strategies to obtain test set:
1.hold-out; 2.cross-validation; 3.bootstrapping(bias)

parameters:
algorithm vs. model

**Quantify the performance**

For regression, the widely adopted performance masurement is mean squared error.  
precision and recall (P-R diagram):BEP(break-even point); F1 harmonic mean  
ROC(Reciever Operating Characteristic) and AUC(Area Under ROC Curve), cost  
hypothesis test  
binomial test; t-test; McNemar-test; Friedman-test   
bias vs. variance vs. noise
