This part is a brief introduction about RSD.

Observation, the accelerating expansion of the Universe.
Peebles,Supernovae et al.

Q: dark energy or modified gravity?

different growth history

test structure growth rate ($f\sigma_8$) from redshift-space distortion (RSD) effect

The observed position of galaxy is distorted by its peculiar velocity.

$$\mathbf{s}=\mathbf{x}+\frac{\mathbf{v}_z}{aH}$$

in which, $\mathbf{v}_z$ is the peculiar velocity along the line of sight direction;
$H$ is Hubble parameter, $a$ scale factor.

First discovered by Jackson, J. C. 1972's paper,
[A CRITIQUE OF REESâ€™S THEORY OF PRIMORDIAL GRAVITATIONAL RADIATION](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/arXiv:0810.3908 "Jackson1972")
known as Fingers of God effect.

The perturbation theory to solve eom.

The statistics, correlation function

$$\xi(\mathbf{r})=\langle\delta(\mathbf{x})\delta(\mathbf{x+r})\rangle$$

and its fourier transformation, power spectrum,

$$P(\mathbf{k})$$

estimators,

measurements:
multiples or wedges
