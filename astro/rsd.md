One of the most important issues in cosmology is to interpret the cosmic acceleration.
Both dark energy and modified gravity can produce the same expansion history.
Yet they predict the different growth histories of the structure.
In observation, to distinguish them, 
one can test the structure growth rate ($f\sigma_8$) through 
the redshift-space distortion (RSD) effect.

The observed position of the galaxy is distorted by its peculiar velocity along the line of sight.  

$$\mathbf{s}=\mathbf{x}+\frac{\mathbf{v}_z}{aH}$$  

Here, $\mathbf{x}$ is the real space position, 
$\mathbf{s}$ is the distorted position in redshift space,
$\mathbf{v}_z$ is the peculiar velocity along the line of sight direction;
$H$ is Hubble parameter, and $a$ is the scale factor.
This effect turns the isotropically distributed pattern of galaxies in real space into anisotropic in redshift space.


RSD effect is first discovered in Jackson, J.C. 1972's paper,
[a critique of reesâ€™s theory of primordial gravitational radiation](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/arXiv:0810.3908 "Jackson1972"){:target="_blank"}.
The very sparse distributed galaxies already exhibit a directional arrangement along the line of sight, known as the Finger of God effect today.
